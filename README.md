The Purpose of the challenge was to use JavaScript to upload earthquake data onto a map using a Mapbox API key. we created different filters to make the map more interactive and display various information. The module consists of 3 parts as seen below 
<br>
<br>1) Part 1: As seen in figure 1, we created a filter to show tectonic plates, and earthquakes 
<br>2) Part 2: As seen in figure 2, we created a filter to show major earthquakes  
<br>3) Part 3: As seen in figure 3, we created a filter to change the colour of the map to a dark view
